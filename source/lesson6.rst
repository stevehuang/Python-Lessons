Lesson 6 - Data Objects and Modules
============

A data type that we have not discussed is **objects**. You can think
of an object as a noun. A noun - person, place, or thing - can perform
actions. You can program objects in a similar manner. An object can
"do things" which you can program using a **method**. Yuo can also
"can describe" it. This is call an **attritute**.

In Python you can create a new type that is an object. This object can
be virtually anything you want. The object can be a ``Person``, a
``Cat``, an ``Animal``, a ``Button``, etc.

Let's go over an example of how to write an object. 

When you define a new type, it's called a class. You need to use the
``class`` keyword.
