Introduction 
-------------------

Coding seems to be the popular trend today. The everyone should learning coding “meme”  trend 

The goal of these lessons is to introduce Python and basic programming and computer science ideas to high school level students & readers. It is assumed that no programming and only basic math skills are needed for these lessons. The lessons cover general concepts and gently introduces Python syntax and usage to students with an emphasis on examples. 

The first half of the lessons covers basic syntax and introduces general programming constructs. After each topic, exercise problems are encouraged to be done. Some exercises extend on the topics covered in the lessons, while others build upon previous lessons. 

There are a few ongoing mini projects to help reinforce concepts and also motivate and encourage readers to try out different things. Some of the mini projects are more open-ended in order to expound the idea there is no one solution to solve a problem. 

The second half of the lessons focus on how to use Python for game development and introduces more computer science ideas. We use a game library called PyGame which is written for Python to expedite game development. As the reader gets more accustomed to the programming language, the problems will shift mode towards problem solving rather than just reiterating a certain topic. 

One of the key things to recognize is that learning to program & code is .

Setup
-----------

Before we start with the lessons, we need to setup your computer with Python. The lessons can be done on Windows OS or Mac OsX. We provide online links to the setup instructions. These instructions are written by Python community developers. Much of the lessons were written with Python version 2.7.x in mind (x means any number). 

Setting up on MacOsX:

What is a computer program?


When you write a program, you write in a language which can be executed by the computer. 
Python Code

Code is a series of statements that are executed in order. Python is
an interpreted language, where the code is executed one line at a
time. You can write code in a file and execute it.

Each set of instructions tell the computer exactly what to do.

# - means comments. When the code is running, the comments are skipped and not executed.
